                <p class="para">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed
                        to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
                        (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                        into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                        included cues for its appearance.</p>

                    <p class="para">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
                        of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
                        MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                        fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
                        specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                        structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
                        pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

                <p class="para">JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
                        technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript
                        on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
                        browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                        standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
                        multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                        application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
                        data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
